# Evolution of Parliamentary Discourse in Germany: A Topic Modeling Approach to the Bundestag
This repository contains the resources, code, and documentation for the computational analysis of parliamentary speeches in the German Bundestag. The project focuses on exploring how political, social, and economic debates have evolved across different legislative periods, using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling.

The main goal is to identify the most salient topics in parliamentary discourse and to analyze their development in relation to historical, political, and socio-economic contexts.
